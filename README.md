This project is aimed at explorig Java using a IDE (Eclipse) while parsing data from https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/. 
The CSV data is the Leading Causes of Death in the US and I have renamed their csv to 'LCD_US.csv'. Forgoing the morbid 
subject, this project is aiming at an object orientated data parse of statistics for various feilds. 

Its obvious that parsing data on 2 or three feilds is easy with bash or another scripting languages. 
e.g `cat LCD_US.csv | grep Heart | grep 2011 | grep Florida`. The purpose of this is to explore Java and 
learn more about templates, Regex, OOP, and modularity with respect to Java.
