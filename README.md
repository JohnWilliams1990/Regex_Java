This project is aimed at explorig Java using a IDE (Eclipse) while parsing data from https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/. 
The CSV data is the Leading Causes of Death in the US and I have renamed their csv to 'LCD_US.csv'. Forgoing the morbid 
subject, this project is aiming at an object orientated data parse of statistics for various feilds.
